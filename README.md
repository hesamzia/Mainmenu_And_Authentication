# Introduction
When I was programming in the past, one of the most important issues in any program was the main menus of the program and creating appropriate access to them for users. It was very difficult when using standard C or ANSI C , but later it became easier with the advent of Visual languages.That's why I thought I'd do this with Python and Flask, and have a standard menu that I could use in any program with a little modification.
In my new programming career, I'm trying to use artificial intelligence as an employee and collaborator. I planned to do this with the help of artificial intelligence and codeium (windsurf).
I didn't have a great experience with Codium when I started working on this project. I realized that AI doesn't have much memory for solving problems, and when you have serial problems, it forgets and doesn't consider previous problems, and sometimes it can get confused. I recommend that you don't give it large programs and try to lead the execution yourself and give it small to medium-sized functions to execute. Make sure the functions you give it are clearly defined with their inputs, outputs, and necessary conditions, and be sure to constantly remind it of these conditions during debugging.
Because of these AI problems, I took help from my dear Google and I will choose one of the existing examples and modify it according to my needs. Along the way, I will take help from Codium. I feel like this is the best way to program right now.
I decided to share this experience with you too.
